We developed a responsive side navigation bar with a hamburger menu for smaller screens. It includes three navigation items and highlights the active item.

### Outcome

The navigation bar layout is correctly implemented, ensuring smooth responsiveness across various devices.

## Task 2: Graph Population Data

### Objective

We aimed to fetch population data from an API and represent it graphically.

### Implementation

Utilizing React JS and Chart.js, we created a graph displaying population data for different nations. The graph includes appropriate labels, legends, and axis titles for clarity.

### Outcome

We successfully retrieved and displayed population data, ensuring accuracy and clear representation on the graph.

## Task 3: Display Cryptocurrency Prices

### Objective

Our objective was to fetch cryptocurrency prices from an API and display them in visually appealing cards.

### Implementation

We fetched cryptocurrency prices asynchronously using React's lifecycle methods. The prices of Bitcoin are displayed in multiple currencies on visually appealing cards.

### Outcome

Cryptocurrency prices are integrated properly and displayed clearly in the card format, maintaining visual appeal and consistency.
